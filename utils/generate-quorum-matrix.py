# This script generates the quorum interconnection matrices for different quorum sizes stored in
# src/quorumnet/conn_matrix.h and used to establish a quorum p2p mesh that establishes a set of
# connections with good partial connectivity using a minimal number of outgoing connections.
#
# It works by looking at the number of different paths of 2 hops or less (1 hop meaning a direct
# connection, 2 meaning a connection that passes through 1 intermediate node) and looks for
# connections between least-connected nodes that increases the most two-hop minimum paths.  It then
# establishes this "best" connection, then restarts, continuing until it has achieved a minimum
# 2-hop connectivity from every node to every other node.
#
# This isn't any guarantee that this procedure generates the absolute best connectivity mesh, but it
# appears to do fairly well.


# If you want to see every path that gets added and the before/after two-hop-connectivity graph
# after each addition, set this to true:
TRACE = False
TRACE = True

# N sizes to calculate for.  The default calculates for all possible quorums that are capable of
# achieving supermajority for blink and obligations quorums (10, 7 required) and checkpoint quorums
# (20, 13 required)
